## Static GitHub Pages mode

This version is **100% static**: it loads the 70 tools from `seed-tools.js` and does **not** require importing/uploading any JSON or saving anything in the browser.

To update statuses, edit `seed-tools.js` and change the `status` field for each tool.


# 🧰 DevOps Tooling Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

A lightweight, **static** web app to showcase your DevOps tooling experience as a portfolio.

It is **static**:
- The app ships as plain HTML/CSS/JS
- The 70 tools are bundled in `seed-tools.js`
- No JSON upload/import is required and nothing is saved in the browser

---

## ✅ Statuses

This version uses 3 portfolio-focused statuses:

- ✅ **Comfortable** (I’ve worked with it and feel confident)
- 🧪 **Used but not comfortable** (I’ve touched it, but I’m not confident yet)
- 🌱 **Plan to learn** (I want to study / gain experience)

You can rename them in `seed-tools.js` if you prefer alternatives like:
- Confident / Familiar / Learning
- Strong / Working knowledge / Next up
